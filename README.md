## Highlights: 
* Created a program that can detect if pneumonia is present in an uploaded image
* Used random oversampling of minority class to handle data imbalance
* Performed data augmentation
* Utilized transfer learning on 5 networks (using weights from Imagenet)
* Created ensemble network to handle classification task based on trained networks
* Packaged into a portable executable file

# [Collection: Blender Animations](https://github.com/LeafyGlance/Blender_Animations)
A small collection of animations and models created from scratch using Blender.

## Highlights: 
* Created models from scratch using low poly art style
* Used keyframing to make simple animation loops
* Experimented with post processing techniques
* Rigged models with custom armatures
